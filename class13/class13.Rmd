Prepare Bio3D and load the PDB structure 
```{r}
library(bio3d)
file.name <- get.pdb("1hsg")
hiv <- read.pdb(file.name)
hiv
```

What is the name of the two non protein resid values in this structure? 
HOH (127), MK1 (1)
What does resid correspond to and how would you get a listing of all reside values in this structure?

```{r}
prot <- trim.pdb(hiv, "protein")
prot
```

```{r}
write.pdb(prot, file = "1hsg_protein")
```


```{r}
lig <- trim.pdb(hiv, "ligand")
lig
```

```{r}
write.pdb(lig, file = "1hsg_ligand")
```
